# mental_health_platform
As a college assingment i have made a mental health platform which is very  much similar to the other websites but the aim of this website is not just to offer doctor to client therapy,
it's also for the people who are actually suffering from depression and they just want someone who can listen to them so in future i'll work on this website to make it
more flexible and add a feature where a user can talk to other user via video or chat without sharing any personal data. The protocols will be followed that the platform won't support or tolerate any kind of :-
1. Pornographic content
2. Nudity
3. Sensetive content
4. Illegal trade
With this scope, i will be working on this website by adding JS and other parts to make it more responsive.
So, Abhishek this side and i present the website HOPE HEAVEN (HTML + CSS)
